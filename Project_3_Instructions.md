# Lance Blackwood's Development Environment  

This procedure will create a development environment suitable to run in a virtual machine.
The environment will focus on an environment using Microsoft Visual Studio Code, a free integrated development environment running on Ubuntu Linux.
There is also an eye on memory footprint, so older tools such as Midnight Commander, Window Maker, and XTerm are used.
Database work will be done with Oracle MySQL Community, and Perl will round out the LAMP stack.
While sonme of these tools are crude, they are available on almost every production server from cloud to telecommunications so learning them is a good idea.
Combining these tools makes for a development environment that matches the production environment.
